# WAH-*i*-Optimiser documentation

WAH-*i* (Widefield Acoustics Heuristic — inverse iterative; pronounced ***waa-hee*** [**/ˈwɑː.hiː/**]) is a MATLAB-based framework and a software tool for designing and optimising 3D microphone-array geometries for TDOA localisation. The GUI supports rapid iteration, evaluation over a user-defined Field of Accuracy (FoA), and iterative optimisation under real-world constraints (arm length, minimum spacing, etc.).

## What you’ll find here

- **Install**: MATLAB Runtime + packaged app installation, and development setup.
- **Download**: get the installable packages for your OS.
- **Quickstart**: the shortest path from “installed” to “first optimisation run”.
- **GUI walkthrough**: what each panel does, and a suggested workflow.
- **Optimisation tips**: staged optimisation, interpreting metrics, and avoiding common traps.
- **FAQ**: deployment, paths, performance, and troubleshooting.

## Recommended first steps
1. Read **Install**
2. Follow **Quickstart**
3. Use **Optimisation tips** when pushing for high pass rates
