# FAQ

## Do I need MATLAB to run the app?
No — the deployed version runs with MATLAB Runtime.

## Which file do I distribute?
Distribute the installer package generated by MATLAB Compiler (your web installer file plus the packaged content). If you’re using a GitHub Release, attach the installer artifacts there.

## How do I publish docs updates?
Edit files in `docs/` and push to `main`. GitHub Pages rebuilds automatically.
